# cellHTS-wrappers
CGI web applications that wrap around cellHTS to process and manage cell base screening data sets


## General notes 

* Write the templates first. View source on existing pages to get a start point
* Break the templates up into re-usable chunks (header, footer, menu etc)
* Note what variables are needed in the templates so we can supply them later in the perl code


## Add new screen
this has a lot of DB calls that could be collected together in one place rather than scattering them through the code
